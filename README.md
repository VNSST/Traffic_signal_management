# Traffic_signal_management
In this project, I have used a video of a road for training. This video has been segmented into 500 frames for the ease of processing.
For the detection of cars, I have used car cascade file and OpenCV.
Then in the final output, a video is created by running the frames together after the traffic analysis and time allotment for the green signal.

### Language used : Python (version 3.7)
### Ide used - Spyder (You can use any)
### Steps:
1. Download all the files in this repository.
2. Then arrange them all in a single folder where all the images, python file and xml file.
3. Run using any python ide. 
### The advantages of this project are:
1. Manual policing can be reduced.
2. Traffic can be controlled by the density based shift approach.
3. Long waiting hours at the signal can be avoided.
